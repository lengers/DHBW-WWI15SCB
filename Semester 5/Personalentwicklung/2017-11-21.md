The cooperative state university in Stuttgart (DHBW) offers dual education programs focused on practical applications. The three-year dual education program is divided into three-month phases alternating between the university and the corporate education partner, in my case IBM. The university phases provide traditional undergraduate education while the other phases provide insights and work experiences in the field of the corporate education partner. This includes a number of IT and strategy consulting projects for an automobile manufacturer and health insurance, as well as sales and marketing:
