A: Damn, Daniel. How's it going?

B: Yo dude. Doin' fine, how 'bout you?

A: Yeah, doin' fine as well, I guess. Listen, man, I missed you at the post mortem meeting for our major key account project. What happened?

B: Sorry, I didn't want to be at this blame-storming event, I'm busy enough covering my ass on our other project. We are behind the curve big time and missed three milestones already. I've got hella lot on my plate and really need to get the ball moving.

A: Dude, it looks like you're slammed. I really wanted to ask you to join our brand new healthcare project. It's a B2B project with a lot of budget and lots of opportunities. Basically, it's a revamped project for an old customer, but adjusted to meet the requirements of upcoming startups. The kickoff's gonna be in a month, if you get your ducks in a row until the project starts I'd be really happy for you to join our team.

B: I don't know, gimme me some granularity.

A: Well, the headcount's gonna be around 30 people. I'm gonna take over the whole project, so that's why I'm able to do the recruiting. Most of the actual will be done by some chimps we'll hire across the big pond.

B: Yeah, um, can u give me  a rough estimate for my salary? Can I take a head position in the project?

A: Sorry man, you can't have the cake and eat it. Although you'll have to start off as a newbie, the position I'm offering you is a windfall, just take it.

B: Alright, thanks for your offer, I'm pretty sure I'll take it. See ya later.
